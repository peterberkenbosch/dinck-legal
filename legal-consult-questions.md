**Prepared for**: Legal consultation
**Date**: February 4, 2026
**Client**: Peter Berkenbosch / PHBX Holding B.V.

## Category A: Resignation Validity & Process

### A1. Effectiveness of Resignation
Is my unilateral resignation as bestuurder legally effective on March 1, 2026, given that Douwine/Marlou state they "cannot agree" with this date?

### A2. Required Formalities
What formalities are required for my resignation to be complete? Is a notarial deed required, or is my written notification sufficient?

### A3. Blocking Attempts
Can Douwine/Marlou legally block or delay my resignation? They claim they "kan en zal niet instemmen met uitschrijving per 1 maart 2026."

### A4. KvK Deregistration
What if they refuse to cooperate with KvK deregistration? Can I deregister myself? What is the process?

### A5. Unanimity Requirement for Resignation
The statutes (Art. 8.6 lid 2) require unanimous AVA decisions. Does this apply to my voluntary resignation, or only to dismissal by the AVA?

---

## Category B: Shareholder Agreement Status

### B1. SHA Defunct Status
Is the SHA now legally defunct since:
- Freca B.V. (original party) is no longer a shareholder
- Marlou Woltmeijer (current 66.7% shareholder) never signed an accession agreement

### B2. Invocation Against Peter
Can Freca or Douwine still invoke SHA provisions against me, even though they are no longer shareholders?

### B3. Non-Compete Clause
Can the non-compete clause (Art. 7 SHA, 3 years after share transfer) be enforced if I sell my shares? Against whom would it be enforceable?

### B4. Buy-Back Rights
Can the buy-back rights (Art. 3.1.h SHA - kooprecht bij ontslag bestuurder) be enforced? By whom?

### B5. Marlou's Position
What is my position if Marlou later claims ignorance of my exit proposal or the negotiations? She was added to CC only on February 2, 2026.

---

## Category C: Minority Shareholder Rights & Veto Power

### C1. Veto Power Scope
Does Art. 8.6 lid 2 of the statutes (unanimity requirement for all AVA decisions) give me effective veto power? How strong is this protection?

### C2. Decisions I Can Block
What specific decisions can I block as 33.3% minority shareholder? The statutes state "alle besluiten worden unaniem genomen."

### C3. Actions Without Consent
What happens if Douwine/Marlou try to act without my consent? What are my remedies?

### C4. Statute Amendment
Can they amend the statutes to remove the unanimity requirement? Would this require my consent?

### C5. Information Rights
What are my Art. 2:217 BW information rights as shareholder, and how do I enforce them if Douwine refuses to provide information?

---

## Category D: Exit Procedures

### D1. Art. 2:343 BW Process
What is the process for Art. 2:343 BW (gedwongen uittreding / geschillenregeling)? What court handles this?

### D2. Grounds Sufficiency
Do my 8 documented incidents of structural exclusion constitute sufficient grounds for Art. 2:343 BW? The law requires "gedragingen van mede-aandeelhouders zodanig dat in redelijkheid niet kan worden gevergd dat je aandeelhouder blijft."

### D3. Costs and Timeline
What costs and timeline should I expect for an Art. 2:343 BW procedure?

### D4. Enquêteprocedure Alternative
Should I pursue Art. 2:345 BW (enquêteprocedure) instead of or in addition to Art. 2:343 BW? What are the strategic considerations?

### D5. Statutory Price Determination
Can I initiate the statutory price determination procedure (Art. 6.2 lid 6 statuten - 3 independent appraisers) unilaterally? What triggers this?

### D6. Realistic Valuation
What is the realistic value of my 33.3% stake given:
- Company has €570K debt (to Douwine's entities)
- ARR is only €6.2K
- Platform replacement value is €150K-200K
- My invested labor value is €195K-220K

---

## Category E: Liability & Risk Assessment

### E1. Bestuurdersaansprakelijkheid Exposure
What is my exposure to bestuurdersaansprakelijkheid (Art. 2:9 BW, Art. 2:248 BW) given that I was systematically excluded from decision-making?

### E2. Debt Claim
Douwine claims I am personally liable for 1/3 of the €570K company debt (€190K). Is there any legal basis for this?

### E3. Vague Threats
Does Douwine's statement "verantwoordelijkheden of aansprakelijkheden verdwijnen niet" have any legal basis? She provides no specific grounds.

### E4. Platform Liability
What is my liability if the platform fails after I stop maintaining it (post-resignation)? Is there any duty to continue?

### E5. KTLO Formalization
Should I formalize the KTLO (keep-the-lights-on) scope in writing to limit my exposure? Currently I am maintaining voluntarily with no agreement.

---

## Category F: Immediate Actions & Strategy

### F1. Actions Before March 1
What should I do between now and March 1, 2026? Any specific steps to protect my position?

### F2. Continue KTLO
Should I continue KTLO maintenance without a formal agreement? What are the risks?

### F3. Preserve Leverage
How do I preserve negotiation leverage while minimizing personal risk?

### F4. Proactive KvK Registration
Should I proactively register my resignation at KvK, or wait for them to cooperate?

### F5. Documentation Preservation
What documentation should I preserve now for potential litigation? Is my current dossier sufficient?

### F6. Proactive Legal Action
Is there a strategic advantage to initiating Art. 2:343 BW proceedings proactively, rather than waiting for the situation to deteriorate further?

---

## Category G: Negotiation Position

### G1. Buyout Proposal Reasonableness
Is my €40K buyout proposal reasonable given:
- Platform value €150K-200K (1/3 = €50K-67K)
- Company debt €570K (but to Douwine's own entities)
- ARR €6.2K (3-5x = €18K-31K, 1/3 = €6K-10K)
- My invested labor €195K-220K

### G2. Actual Leverage
What leverage do I actually have as minority shareholder with veto power but no operational control?

### G3. Future Communications
How should I respond to future communications from Douwine/Marlou? Should I continue direct communication?

### G4. Lawyer Communication
Should all communication go through a lawyer from this point forward?

## Specific Factual Clarifications Needed

1. **The "22 January Agreement"**: Douwine claims we made an explicit agreement on January 22 to schedule a meeting. In reality, on that date she acknowledged her delay and promised to send dates (which she never did). How do I counter this narrative if it becomes relevant?

2. **Douwine's "Aandeelhouder" Claim**: In her February 1 email, Douwine claims to act as "aandeelhouder." Freca sold to Marlou on November 7, 2025. Should I formally challenge this false representation?

3. **Conflict of Interest**: Douwine explicitly states she acts "vanuit mijn positie als financier van Dinck B.V." while also being bestuurder. Is this conflict of interest actionable?

4. **Marlou's Knowledge**: Marlou was not informed about my exit proposal until February 2, 2026 (when I added her to CC). What implications does this have for her position as majority shareholder?

# Dinck B.V. - Legal Preparedness Assessment

**Date**: 6 February 2026
**Client**: Peter Berkenbosch / PHBX Holding B.V.
**Purpose**: Pre-consultation assessment for lawyer meeting

---

## 1. Situation Summary (as of 6 Feb 2026)

### What's Strong

| Strength | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| **Veto right** (Art. 8.6 lid 2 statuten: unanimity) | Peter can block ANY shareholder decision - dilution, statute changes, dividends, director appointments |
| **Platform indispensability** | Peter built the sole valuable asset; replacement cost €150-200K; Douwine cannot maintain it |
| **8 documented exclusion incidents** | Solid foundation for Art. 2:343 BW (forced buyout) if needed |
| **SHA is void for Marlou** | Removes non-compete (Art. 7 SHA only triggers on share sale), removes Douwine's contractual levers |
| **13+ months unpaid work** | Demonstrates exploitation; strengthens "unreasonable to remain" argument under Art. 2:343 |
| **Clean correspondence record** | Peter's communications are professional, factual, legally precise; Douwine's contain factual errors and threats. See `analyse/correspondentie-analyse.md` |
| **Resignation is unilateral** | Cannot be blocked, contested, or conditioned by Douwine/Marlou |
| **Management agreement still active** | Never formally terminated; Art. 4.2 vrijwaring (indemnification) still protects PHBX. See `analyse/managementovereenkomst-analyse.md` |
| **Both fees stopped equally (Art. 3.1 complied with)** | Both management fees stopped from 1 Dec 2024. Freca's €64K on balance sheet is unpaid fee for Apr-Nov 2024 (same period Peter was paid). Not a violation. |
| **Unjust enrichment basis** | ~1,360 hours unpaid work under fulltime contractual obligation (Art. 2.3); estimated value €102-170K |
| **Loan is mutual assured destruction** | Freca calling the loan = Dinck bankrupt = Douwine's €612K lost. Limits her actual options despite contractual power. See `analyse/geldlening-analyse.md` |
| **Douwine's conflict of interest self-documented** | She wrote: "handel ik niet alleen vanuit mijn rol als bestuurder en aandeelhouder, maar nadrukkelijk ook vanuit mijn positie als financier" |

### What's Vulnerable

| Vulnerability | Risk Level | Action Needed |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Loan acceleration risk** | **CRITICAL** | First repayment ~€65-75K due 28 March 2026; Dinck cannot pay; default triggers full loan recall. See `analyse/geldlening-analyse.md` |
| **Art. 7.1.g cessation trigger** | **HIGH** | If Peter stops all work AND platform stalls, Freca can call the entire loan immediately (no notice) |
| **Art. 7.2 no-reason recall** | **HIGH** | Freca can call the full loan (~€500K) at ANY time with just 3 months notice, no reason needed |
| **No D&O insurance** | HIGH | Check immediately if Dinck has a policy; if not, consider personal coverage before 1 March |
| **Still working unpaid incl. feature dev** | HIGH | Creates impression of acceptance; continued feature work weakens negotiating position |
| **Addendum signed under pressure** | MEDIUM | Peter signed €500K addendum 14 days after income cut; possible misbruik van omstandigheden but needs legal assessment |
| **No written KTLO/work agreement** | MEDIUM | All current work is goodwill with no contractual protection |
| **Litigation budget constrained** | MEDIUM | Affects strategy: negotiation/pressure preferred over court proceedings |
| **Information asymmetry** | MEDIUM | No formal information agreement; only statutory Art. 2:217 BW rights post-resignation |
| **KvK still shows Peter as director** | LOW-MED | Liable as apparent director until deregistered; plan to deregister 1 March is fine |
| **Douwine's silence** | LOW | May be consulting own lawyer; silence itself is not problematic |

---

## 2. Critical Gaps to Address

### Gap 1: STOP UNPAID FEATURE DEVELOPMENT (Urgent)

Peter is doing **feature development for free**. This is the single biggest strategic mistake right now:
- It reduces Douwine's urgency to negotiate (she's getting free work)
- It could be argued Peter implicitly accepted unpaid status
- It erodes the "nuclear option" leverage (platform dependency)
- It is economically irrational and undermines credibility

**Recommendation**: Immediately stop all new feature development. Continue only critical KTLO (platform-down, security patches) until 1 March, then reassess. After 1 March, Peter has zero obligation to do any work.

### Gap 2: D&O Insurance (Urgent)

Peter doesn't know if he has directors & officers liability insurance. Douwine has made (empty) threats about director liability.

**Action**:
- Check if Dinck B.V. has a D&O policy that covers Peter
- If not: consider obtaining personal coverage for the remaining 23 days of directorship
- After 1 March: director liability exposure ends for future acts (but historical claims have 5-year window)

### Gap 3: No Written Record of Unpaid Work Hours

The dossier estimates ~2,600 hours total but doesn't have a detailed time log post-December 2024.

**Action**: Create a retroactive summary of work performed since management fee ended (Jan 2025 - present). Include: dates, hours, nature of work (KTLO vs. feature dev), market value. This supports both negotiation leverage and potential unjust enrichment claims.

### Gap 4: Marlou Has Never Been Directly Engaged

All negotiations are with Douwine, who is NOT a shareholder. Marlou (the actual 66.7% holder) has been CC'd once (Peter's Feb 2 email) but has never responded or participated.

**Question for lawyer**: Should Peter formally address Marlou directly as the legal counterparty? Douwine negotiating on behalf of a proxy she controls is legally unusual.

### Gap 5: Notarial Deed of Share Transfer - OBTAINED

~~The dossier flags that the signed notarial deed of the Freca → Marlou transfer has not been obtained.~~

**Status**: Deed obtained on 6 February 2026. Full analysis in `analyse/notariele-akte-analyse.md`.

**Key findings from the deed**:
- **Koopprijs €1,00 confirmed** - supports sham transaction argument
- **Purchase agreement was ORAL** - no written contract exists; Art. 12 states the deed IS the full agreement
- **Buyback clause (€1.50) is NOT in the deed** - this is a purely oral side-deal with no written evidence
- **Peter's pre-emptive right waiver was LIMITED** - "uitsluitend voor deze levering en een mogelijke teruglevering door koper aan verkoper" - any other transfer by Marlou reactivates Peter's pre-emptive right
- **No SHA reference whatsoever** - confirms Marlou never acceded to the SHA
- **"Mogelijke teruglevering" language** - the deed itself contemplates a return transfer, supporting the sham transaction narrative
- **Parties waived all dissolution rights** (Art. 10/11) - complicates undoing the transfer
- **Peter signed in dual capacity** - as PHBX Holding (shareholder) AND as Dinck B.V. (director recognizing the transfer)

**New questions for lawyer**: See `analyse/notariele-akte-analyse.md` section 4 for 6 specific questions arising from the deed.

## 3. Strategic Assessment Given Constraints

Given that litigation is financially difficult, the optimal strategy is **pressure without litigation**:

### Recommended Approach: "Credible Threat + Time Pressure"

1. **Stop feature development immediately** - KTLO only until 1 March
2. **Resign + deregister KvK on 1 March** - as planned
3. **After 1 March: set 30-day window** for Douwine to engage on exit terms
4. **If no engagement by April**: Send formal Art. 2:217 BW information request (free, signals escalation)
5. **If stonewalled**: Send demand letter (via lawyer) referencing Art. 2:343 BW grounds - the 8 documented incidents make this credible
6. **KTLO as leverage**: After 1 March, Peter has ZERO obligation to maintain the platform. Conditioning continued KTLO on meaningful negotiation is legitimate
7. **Reserve litigation**: Art. 2:343 as last resort; the credible threat may be sufficient

### Why This Works Without Going to Court

- Douwine's €612K investment depends entirely on Peter's platform working
- Without KTLO: bugs accumulate, platform degrades, customers churn
- Hiring an external developer: €100-150/hr without codebase knowledge, months to onboard
- Peter's veto blocks any strategic pivot Douwine attempts via AVA
- Time is on Peter's side; Douwine's investment erodes without technical maintenance

### Loan Dynamics Add Urgency (NEW)

The loan agreement creates additional pressure on BOTH sides:
- **28 March 2026**: First repayment due (~€65-75K). Dinck cannot pay. This is 27 days after Peter's resignation.
- **Douwine's dilemma**: If she calls the loan via Freca → Dinck goes bankrupt → her own €612K is lost
- **Peter's counter-leverage**: Management agreement claims (unjust enrichment €102-170K for fulltime unpaid work) can offset some of the loan pressure
- **Mutual Assured Destruction**: Neither party benefits from Dinck's failure. This strengthens the case for negotiated settlement.
- **The real weapon is Art. 7.2** (no-reason recall with 3 months notice), not the empty director liability threats. But using it is self-destructive for Douwine.

## 4. Lawyer Meeting Preparation Points

Questions to bring to the lawyer consultation:

### On Director Liability
1. Does Dinck B.V. have D&O insurance covering Peter?
2. Given 8 documented incidents of exclusion from decision-making, how strong is Peter's defense against any Art. 2:9 BW claim?
3. Is there any risk from the 5-year look-back period after 1 March?

### On Exit Strategy
4. Is Art. 2:343 BW (forced buyout) viable given the 8 documented incidents? What are realistic costs?
5. Can Peter condition KTLO maintenance on negotiation progress without this being construed as abuse of rights?
6. Should Peter formally demand Marlou sign a toetredingsovereenkomst (SHA accession agreement)?
7. What is the legal status of the Freca → Marlou transfer (€1 price, pre-agreed €1.50 buyback)?

### On Unpaid Work
8. Does 13+ months of unpaid feature development constitute unjust enrichment (ongerechtvaardigde verrijking)?
9. Can Peter claim compensation for work performed beyond what was agreed at the AVA of 30 November 2024?
10. The AVA decision said "temporary until sufficient revenue" - has this condition been properly evaluated?

### On Current Situation
11. Should Peter immediately cease all unpaid feature development?
12. Should Peter formally address Marlou (not Douwine) as the legal shareholder counterparty?
13. How should Peter handle the KvK deregistration if Douwine refuses to cooperate?

### On the Loan Agreement (NEW - from source document analysis)
14. The loan addendum (increasing limit to €500K) was signed 14 days after Peter's management fee was unilaterally stopped. Is there a basis for annulment under Art. 3:44 lid 4 BW (misbruik van omstandigheden)?
15. First repayment (~€65-75K) is due 28 March 2026 - Dinck cannot pay. What are the legal consequences when Freca does NOT immediately call the loan? Does this create a pattern of acquiescence?
16. Douwine is bestuurder of both Freca (creditor) and Dinck (debtor). How does Art. 2:239 lid 6 BW (tegenstrijdig belang) apply when Freca calls the loan?
17. Does Peter's resignation as director trigger Art. 7.1.g ("staking bedrijfsuitoefening")? Or only when Dinck actually ceases operations?
18. Art. 9: Has Freca provided annual balance statements? Has Dinck timely objected (6-week window)? If not, is the balance legally established?

### On the Management Agreement (NEW - from source document analysis)
19. Does the management agreement end automatically when Peter resigns as director, or does formal termination with 3-month notice apply?
20. Can PHBX claim unjust enrichment (Art. 6:212 BW) for ~1,360 hours of unpaid work under the fulltime obligation (Art. 2.3)?
21. The AVA decision was explicitly temporary ("indien de opbrengsten... op een voldoende niveau komen"). Has this condition ever been formally evaluated? What are the consequences of non-review?

### On Valuation
22. What is the most cost-effective way to establish share value? (Statutory 3-expert mechanism vs. single independent valuation)
23. How is Peter's €195-220K labor investment treated in a share valuation?

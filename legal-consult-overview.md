# Legal Consultation Overview - Dinck B.V. Exit

**Prepared for**: Legal consultation
**Date**: February 4, 2026
**Client**: Peter Berkenbosch / PHBX Holding B.V.

---

## A. Executive Summary

Peter Berkenbosch, through PHBX Holding B.V., is a 33.3% shareholder and co-founder of Dinck B.V., a SaaS platform for childcare administration. Since the company's founding in March 2024, Peter has been systematically excluded from decision-making by Douwine Koopman. Douwine initially held 66.7% of shares through her company Freca B.V., but transferred these to Marlou Woltmeijer (a straw buyer/employee) in November 2025. As a result, Douwine currently has no shareholder status, but remains on the board as bestuurder and maintains de facto control through various entities (Freca B.V., Voor Dag en Dou B.V.). After failed equity buyout negotiations and continued exclusion, Peter submitted his resignation as bestuurder on January 30, 2026, effective March 1, 2026. Douwine and Marlou are contesting the resignation, though their objections lack legal basis since resignation as bestuurder is a unilateral legal act requiring no consent.
